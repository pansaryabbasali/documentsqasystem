"""Vendored llm_gateway sanity: importable, expected version, public API intact.

These tests make no network calls. The gateway's full behavioral suite (80 offline
tests) lives in its source repository; here we only guard the vendored copy's
integrity — that the package is present, complete, and exposes the API doc_qa
will build on (ask/Gateway, message models, the exhaustion error).
